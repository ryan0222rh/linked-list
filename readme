I have made multiple attempts to contact the university through phone calls, emails, and social media messages, but I have received no response. I also reached out to their dean, Emily Doe (sister), who informed me that she has not been in contact with them recently. Despite these efforts, I have been unable to obtain their consent for the child's passport admission. Given the lack of communication and unsuccessful attempts to reach them, I am unable to secure their signature or approval.
